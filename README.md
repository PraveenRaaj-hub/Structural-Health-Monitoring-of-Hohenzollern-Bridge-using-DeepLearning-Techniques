# Structural-Health-Monitoring-using-DeepLearning
Built a Python program using LSTM and U-net architecure models to detect and locate structural defects in the Hohenzollernbrücke (Köln) from FEM-simulated data under various loading conditions.
Group-14.ipynb contains preprocessing,classifying data under different pre loading condition and defect type using both LSTM and U-net.
LSTM.ipynb  contains different approach to LSTM to identify location defect.
