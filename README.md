# Structural-Health-Monitoring-using-DeepLearning
Built a Python program using LSTM and CNN models to detect and locate structural defects in the Hohenzollernbrücke (Köln) from FEM-simulated data under various loading conditions.
Group-14 ipynb contains preprocessing,classifying data under different pre loading condition and defect type. Then running LSTM to identify type of defect and U-Net to identify the position.
